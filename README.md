# Genetic-Algorithm-for-Neural-Network-Training-on-CartPole-Environment
This project implements a genetic algorithm to train a neural network for solving the CartPole environment in OpenAI's Gym. The neural network is optimized to balance the pole on the cart using evolutionary strategies, such as crossover and mutation, to evolve the weights of the network.
